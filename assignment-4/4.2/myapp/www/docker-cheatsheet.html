<p>Docker has its own terminology, which I'll be using throughout this introduction. Take a minute to familiarize yourself with these terms:</p>

<p><strong>Docker engine:</strong> The process running on your production machine that sits between your running Docker application and the underlying operating system and hardware.
<strong>Dockerfile:</strong> A text file that contains the instructions (or commands) used to build a Docker image.
<strong>Docker image:</strong> The result of building a Dockerfile and executing the Dockerfile's commands. It is constructed from a root operating system, installed applications, and commands executed in such a way that it can run your application. A Docker image serves as the basis for Docker containers and is the static template from which they are created.
<strong>Docker container:</strong> A runtime instance of a Docker image. Whereas the Docker image is like a template (built from a Dockerfile that contains the correct operating system, applications, and commands used to build the image), the container is an actual running instance of that image.
<strong>Docker host:</strong> A physical or virtual machine that runs the Docker engine to host your Docker container's DockerHub.
<strong>DockerHub:</strong> The repository that hosts Docker images. Think of a DockerHub being to Docker images what GitHub is to Git repositories: a central location for hosting and serving up Docker images.</p>
